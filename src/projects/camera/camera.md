projectDescription: "The goal of this project is to create a camera concept where the hardware and software are designed holistically. There are a couple of problems with most cameras out there today that I wanted to focus on. How might we ease the learning curve required for many proffessional-grade cameras today? How might we give people more ownership of the images that they take? How might we create a more succinct overlap in the way that hardware and software in cameras interact today? These are all questions that I aimed to provide one answer to."

        I illustrated the orthaganol views of the camera to help with menu systems within the systems UI, and also to be used to help communicate interactions with the dial and lens ring.
