projectSubTitle: "A computer mouse design that incorporates a novel way to scroll"
projectDescription: "How many times does the average person click on their computer mouse a day? How many pixels do they move across their screen? How far do they scroll? Our computer mice get used a hell of a lot. Acknowledging this, I couldn't help but recognize a huge opportunity for impact. If you can make any type of small incremental improvement to a computer mouse, it would equal a huge amount of value over it's lifetime."

        To help with packaging, and to help map out some of the interactions that I was imagining around the scroll behaviour, i recreated the profiles of the mouse in it's light and dark variants.

        Owning a home is a pretty daunting task, one which can come with a lot of complexity. With the illustrations, I wanted to execute a style that was simple and approachable.
