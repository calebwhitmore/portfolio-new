        Branding
    </h4>
    <h4 class="project-description">
        Micasa's mission is to help people keep their home in shape. Following this, for the branding I started to play off shapes that included metaphors for the home and health, incorporating them in as many ways as I could.

        Owning a home is a pretty daunting task, one which can come with a lot of complexity. With illustration I aimed to make the task seem more approachable, through a simple and clean style.

        There are two audiences for Micasa, and two faces of the product to meet those audiences. The Home owners center, and the Agents center. One of the most important parts of this project was to bring people into the platform and encourage them to sign up - especially important with a product still in it's infancy.
