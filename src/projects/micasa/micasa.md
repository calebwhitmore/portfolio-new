        Branding
    </h4>
    <h4 class="project-description">
        Micasa's mission is to help people keep their home in shape. Following this, for the branding I started to play off shapes that included metaphors for the home and health, incorporating them in as many ways as I could. You can see a couple of these explorations here, and the final brand and word mark are further below.
